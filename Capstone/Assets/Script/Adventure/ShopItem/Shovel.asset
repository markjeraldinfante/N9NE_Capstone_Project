  ItemDescription: Junnie's first investment for his employment as a construction
    worker was this shovel. Its strong design assures that it will resist extensive
    usage, and its sharp edge enables for effective digging. It is sure to knock
    out foes, although it is not as stealthy as other weapons owing to its substance.
