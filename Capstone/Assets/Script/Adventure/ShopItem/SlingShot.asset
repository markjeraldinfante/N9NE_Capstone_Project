  ItemDescription: Omar's father manufactured this slingshot as a gift for his son.
    It is a flexible weapon that may be used to discreetly eliminate opponents by
    striking targets at a distance. Slingshots generally have a modest ammunition
    capacity but are simple to operate and reload quickly. It may also be used to
    distract attackers, allowing players to sneak by unnoticed.
